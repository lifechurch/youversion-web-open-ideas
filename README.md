The purpose of this repo is to create a place for volunteer contributors to post potential solutions to issues, mostly as one-off React Components, or small collections of components/pages.

The project contained here should have an extremely-low-friction setup, and be relatively easy to contribute potential React-based solutions to.

"Official" issues that are ready to be worked on are marked with the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/lifechurch/youversion-web-open-ideas/labels/help%20wanted) label. We may institute other labels or methods of organization later.

## What it looks like

When run, the project should display a "table of contents" menu or list of links to "solutions" related to [issues from this repo](https://github.com/lifechurch/youversion-web-open-ideas/issues).

Following one of those links should navigate to a page showing a potential solution.
